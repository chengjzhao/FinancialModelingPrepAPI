#### What is coverage?
Code coverage is a measure of how well you are testing your project. If a project has 99% coverage, that means that 99% of the lines, functions and/or branches of the files included in your tests are covered by tests. A line, function or branch is covered when said line, function or branch is executed in one or more of your tests.
